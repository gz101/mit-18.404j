\begin{question}{Book 2.32}{[proving non-CFL]}

% Let \(\Sigma = \{1,2,3,4\}\) and \(C=\{w \in \Sigma^* | \text{ in } w, \text{ the number of 1s equals the number of 2s, and the number of 3s equals the number of 4s }\}\). Show that \(C\) is not context-free.

Let \(\Sigma = \{1,2,3,4\}\) and \(C=\{w \in \Sigma^* | \text{ in } w, \text{ the number of 1s equals the number of 2s, and the }\) \(\text{number of 3s equals the number of 4s }\}\). Show that \(C\) is not context-free.

(Note that the result of this problem demonstrates that the class of CFLs isnâ€™t closed under either complement or intersection. Check that you understand why.)
